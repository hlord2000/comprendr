1
00:00:00.42 --> 00:00:04.340
We're asked to multiply 5/6
times 2/3 and then simplify

2
00:00:04.34 --> 00:00:05.570
our answer.

3
00:00:05.57 --> 00:00:07.450
So let's just multiply
these two numbers.

4
00:00:07.45 --> 00:00:13.090
So we have 5/6 times 2/3.

5
00:00:13.09 --> 00:00:15.030
Now when you're multiplying
fractions, it's actually a

6
00:00:15.03 --> 00:00:17.470
pretty straightforward
process.

7
00:00:17.47 --> 00:00:20.190
The new numerator, or the
numerator of the product, is

8
00:00:20.19 --> 00:00:22.880
just the product of the two
numerators, or your new top

9
00:00:22.88 --> 00:00:25.340
number is a product of the
other two top numbers.

10
00:00:25.34 --> 00:00:29.240
So the numerator in our product
is just 5 times 2.

11
00:00:29.24 --> 00:00:37.250
So it's equal to 5 times 2 over
6 times 3, which is equal

12
00:00:37.25 --> 00:00:43.490
to-- 5 times 2 is 10 and
6 times 3 is 18, so

13
00:00:43.49 --> 00:00:44.710
it's equal to 10/18.

14
00:00:44.71 --> 00:00:50.820
And you could view this as
either 2/3 of 5/6 or 5/6 of

15
00:00:50.82 --> 00:00:53.640
2/3, depending on how you
want to think about it.

16
00:00:53.64 --> 00:00:54.750
And this is the right answer.

17
00:00:54.75 --> 00:00:57.220
It is 10/18, but when you look
at these two numbers, you

18
00:00:57.22 --> 00:00:59.460
immediately or you might
immediately see that they

19
00:00:59.46 --> 00:01:01.500
share some common factors.

20
00:01:01.5 --> 00:01:03.990
They're both divisible by 2,
so if we want it in lowest

21
00:01:03.99 --> 00:01:07.020
terms, we want to divide
them both by 2.

22
00:01:07.02 --> 00:01:12.800
So divide 10 by 2, divide 18 by
2, and you get 10 divided

23
00:01:12.8 --> 00:01:17.510
by 2 is 5, 18 divided
by 2 is 9.

24
00:01:17.51 --> 00:01:19.920
Now, you could have essentially
done this step

25
00:01:19.92 --> 00:01:20.630
earlier on.

26
00:01:20.63 --> 00:01:22.530
You could've done it actually
before we did the

27
00:01:22.53 --> 00:01:23.220
multiplication.

28
00:01:23.22 --> 00:01:24.450
You could've done
it over here.

29
00:01:24.45 --> 00:01:26.450
You could've said, well, I have
a 2 in the numerator and

30
00:01:26.45 --> 00:01:29.260
I have something divisible by 2
into the denominator, so let

31
00:01:29.26 --> 00:01:32.710
me divide the numerator by
2, and this becomes a 1.

32
00:01:32.71 --> 00:01:37.090
Let me divide the denominator
by 2, and this becomes a 3.

33
00:01:37.09 --> 00:01:42.070
And then you have 5 times 1
is 5, and 3 times 3 is 9.

34
00:01:42.07 --> 00:01:44.200
So it's really the same thing
we did right here.

35
00:01:44.2 --> 00:01:47.370
We just did it before we
actually took the product.

36
00:01:47.37 --> 00:01:49.220
You could actually
do it right here.

37
00:01:49.22 --> 00:01:53.890
So if you did it right over
here, you'd say, well, look, 6

38
00:01:53.89 --> 00:01:56.190
times 3 is eventually going
to be the denominator.

39
00:01:56.19 --> 00:02:00.030
5 times 2 is eventually going
to be the numerator.

40
00:02:00.03 --> 00:02:03.660
So let's divide the numerator by
2, so this will become a 1.

41
00:02:03.66 --> 00:02:05.180
Let's divide the denominator
by 2.

42
00:02:05.18 --> 00:02:07.550
This is divisible by 2,
so that'll become a 3.

43
00:02:07.55 --> 00:02:13.630
And it'll become 5 times 1
is 5 and 3 times 3 is 9.

44
00:02:13.63 --> 00:02:15.210
So either way you do
it, it'll work.

45
00:02:15.21 --> 00:02:18.450
If you do it this way, you get
to see the things factored out

46
00:02:18.45 --> 00:02:20.910
a little bit more, so it's
usually easier to recognize

47
00:02:20.91 --> 00:02:23.200
what's divisible by what, or you
could do it at the end and

48
00:02:23.2 --> 00:02:25.400
put things in lowest terms.
