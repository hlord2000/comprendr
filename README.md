This website allows for YouTube video URL input and minimizes user time by customizing the video playback speed. The video is optimized using Google APIs and output in a fast, agile framework of web-development.

## Usage
provide examples of inputs and outputs to the website

## Google APIs

The **YouTube Data API v3** is used to extract captions from the desired YouTube video by speech-to-text transcription or provided by the video uploader.

The **Cloud Natural Language API** interprets the captions and analyzes the importance of words by assigning a salience score. Higher salience scores imply high importance of the word and therefore more relevant to the viewer.

Playback speeds are then assigned for sections of the video according to the average salience score of sections. Low salience sections are given higher playback speed, and vise versa.
